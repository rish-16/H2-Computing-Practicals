Vending machine change.
Your program should simulate the calculation of the change that a vending machine must return. The vending machine only sells drinks that cost $1.20 and $0.80. The machine only accepts 10-cent, 20- cent, 50-cent, and 1-dollar coins. It must return the least possible number of coins.
The problem:
• The vending machine only sells drinks that either cost $0.80 or $1.20
• The vending machine may only accept 10-cent, 20-cent, 50-cent, and 1-dollar coins
• The vending machine has an unlimited supply of the coins it accepts
• There is no limit on the amount of money a person can insert before making a purchase (and then receiving change). However, we assume that the person has already inserted all the money that he or she wants to, and has already chosen the drink to purchase.
• Your program must ask for 5 inputs:
    • The amount of 10-cent coins that the user has inserted.
    • The amount of 20-cent coins that the user has inserted.
    • The amount of 50-cent coins that the user has inserted.
    • The amount of 1-dollar coins that the user has inserted.
    • The choice of a $0.80 or $1.20 drink (note, you should expect that the value of allthe coins inserted must be greater than the cost of the drink selected).
• Calculate and print the number each type of coin to return as change such that the totalnumber of coins returned by the machine is the least possible.
