"""
Boolean operators can seem tricky at first, and it takes practice to evaluate them correctly.
Write the value (True or False) produced by each expression below, using the assigned values of the variables a, b, and c.
Try to do this without using your interpreter, but you should check yourself when you think you've got it.
Hint: Work from the inside out, starting with the innermost expressions, similar to arithmetic. Let:
            a = False
            b = True
            c = False
Would the expressions below evaluate to True or False?

i. b and c
ii. b or c
iii. not a and b
iv. (a and b) or not c
v. not b and not (a or c)

ANSWER:

1. False
2. True
3. True
4. True
5. False
